## Building the SDK

### Introduction

The Capturoo JavaScript SDK is built with a series of individual packages that are
all contained in this repository.

Each package in the `packages` directory, constitute a pice of our
implementation. The SDK is built via a combination of all of these packages
which are published under the [`capturoo`
scope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope%3Acapturoo) on NPM.
